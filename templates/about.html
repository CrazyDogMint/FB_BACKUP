<h1>About</h1>
<p>This tool is made by <a href="https://facebook.com/kong.sex">Kong</a> in Taiwan. But the site you see may be maintained by other people.</p>
<p>You can download data from Facebook, including posts, photos, comments, without losing data of author, time, link to the origin page, tags and links. You can consider the exported data as a backup of Facebook. Data possible to download is those of you, groups you manage, public pages, and public events.</p>
<p>This tool use Facebook <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api">Graph API</a> to get data. Therefore data not accessible by the API is never possible for this tool to download, either. For example, it's not possible to get all posts of a specific user who doesn't authorize the app, even if the posts are all public. (Other tools may be able to do that, but not Facebook Graph API.)</p>
<p>You can find codes of this tool on <a href="https://github.com/kong0107/facebook-backup">GitHub</a>. And you can have your own website to allow you (and your friends, if you like) download data from Facebook as your wish.</p>
